# Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

This project was part of the AI-Programming with Python Nanodregree by Udacity.

Principal Objectives
Correctly identify which pet images are of dogs (even if breed is misclassified) and which pet images aren't of dogs.

Correctly classify the breed of dog, for the images that are of dogs.

Determine which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG), "best" achieve the objectives 1 and 2.

Consider the time resources required to best achieve objectives 1 and 2, and determine if an alternative solution would have given a "good enough" result, given the amount of time each of the algorithms take to run.
